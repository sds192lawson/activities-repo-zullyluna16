```{r}
nba_data <- read.csv("nba2024.csv", header = T)

```

nba_data: which variable is numeric- and which is continuous- age

```{r}
ggplot(nba_data, aes(x = Age))+
  geom_histogram(fill = "purple", color= "white", binwidth = 10)+
    labs(title= "Age of NBA Players, 2024 Season, USA", x = "Age of PLayers", y= "Count")+
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(Age)), color = "red")


```

create bar plot: choose a variable that is categorical- position

```{r}
ggplot(nba_data, aes(x = Pos))+
  geom_bar(fill= "purple", color= "white")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title= "Position of NBA Players, 2024 Season, USA", x = "Position of Players", y= "Count")
```

when using coord_flip(), use the same aes() as it were not flipped
